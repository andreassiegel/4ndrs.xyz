JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE I have ever worked with, and I guess don't ever want to use anything else - or the tool I would prefer to use instead is yet to be invented.

## Where it all started

Most of the time, I used IntelliJ for Java development. Everything just works, right out of the box. Awesome!
However, then there is this moment where you use something else, Node.js for instance.
And, of course, you want to use it with the same ease.

For run configurations to execute the application, everything is fine. Right-click on the application's main `*.js` file and it runs. Great!

What about tests? In Java projects, I do a right-click on the test sources root, and it just works. IntelliJ runs JUnit and I can easily select which tests to run, etc.

## Moving on to JavaScript/Node.js

Okay, let's get away from Java, let's set up a Node.js project, add a `__tests__` folder, and use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for delightful JavaScript testing.
That's easy enough:

```shell script
$ npm init
// ...
// Answer some questions and finish the initialization of the new project
// ...
$ mkdir __tests__
```

## Configure Jest

Now, we just need to configure Jest in the `package.json` file to run our tests:

```json
{
  "name": "hello-jest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Just a sample on how to run tests with Jest",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npx jest"
  },
  "author": "John Doe",
  "license": "ISC",
  "jest": {
    "verbose": true,
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "testRegex": "(/__tests__/.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.jsx?$"
  }
}
```

Before we go on, we probably want to ensure you have Jest installed on our machine:

```shell script
$ npm install -g jest
```

This is all we need to set up. Easy enough, right?

## A First Test

Let's quickly add some sample test so that we actually have something to run:
Since we configured Jest to run tests that match a certain regular expression, we create a new file in the `__tests__` folder and name it `hello.test.js`:

```js
describe('Example Test', () => {
  it('ensures 1 + 1 = 2', () => {
    const a = 1
    const b = 1
    const c = a + b

    expect(c).toEqual(2)
  })
})
```

## Run the Test from the Command Line

To actually run the test, head back to the command line and run this command:

```shell script
$ npm test
```

You should get some output like this:

```
> hello-test@1.0.0 test /Users/andreas/Documents/development/hello-test
> npx jest

 PASS  __tests__/index.test.js
  Example Test
    âœ“ ensures 1 + 1 = 2 (3ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.79s, estimated 1s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Set up the Project in IntelliJ

I love the command line but, as I already said, I also like my IntelliJ IDE.
During development, I would like to be able to run tests often, selectively, and as easy as possible.

Therefore, I want to use my favorite tool to work with our little project.
If we did not create the project in IntelliJ already, we have to import the project there.

Go to _File > New > Project from Existing Sources..._ and navigate to the directory containing the project we just created.
I select the `package.json` file (I import Java projects selecting the `pom.xml` Maven file) and click _Open_.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/js-test-intellij/cannot-import.png" alt="Cannot Import" caption="Cannot Import anything..." >}}

Well, that is not exactly what we wanted to happen, right?

Next, don't select any particular file, just navigate to the project folder and click _Open_.
That should work and you can proceed clicking _Next_ until there is no option to click _Next_ anymore.

**Lesson learned: If you import JavaScript projects in IntelliJ, always select the project folder!**

## Use IntelliJ to run the Tests

Now that we were able to import the project successfully, it's time to run the tests again.

### No Working Default

Above, I said it's possible to run Java tests from the context menu.
Trying the same for a JavaScript project doesn't seem to be that successful:

{{< figure src="/images/posts/js-test-intellij/context-run.png" alt="Context Menu Run: No tests" caption="Nothing to run here..." >}}

Unfortunately, the cute little Gopher won't be able to help us with this problem.

Given the wide variety of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, it's not really a surprise that there is no working default run configuration, though.
Marking the `__tests__` folder as "test sources root" also doesn't change anything, by the way - except for the icon turning green.

### Create a Run Configuration for Jest

So we have to head to the top-right corner to edit the run configurations,
and add a new Jest run configuration.

For that, we will have to enter the path to the Jest installation.
This had been displayed after installing Jest:

```shell script
$ npm install -g jest
npm WARN deprecated resolve-url@0.2.1: https://github.com/lydell/resolve-url#deprecated
npm WARN deprecated urix@0.1.0: Please see https://github.com/lydell/urix#deprecated
npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
/usr/local/bin/jest -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js
+ jest@25.3.0
added 484 packages from 287 contributors in 24.374s
```

The path that we will need is `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/jest`.
Don't worry if we didn't capture that.
It's just in the default root path for NPM packages,
and we can check the configuration for that pretty easily:

```shell script
$ npm root -g
/usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

With that information, we can configure a new run configuration for _Jest_.
Click the `+` Icon and type to search for _Jest_. 

{{< figure src="/images/posts/js-test-intellij/jest-runconfig.png" alt="Jest Run Configuration" caption="Jest Run Configuration" >}}

There is not much we have to configure here, just:
 
- set the path to the Jest package
- make sure the project directory is set as working directory (default)
- select _All tests_ (default)

By the way, we could also add `jest` to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and configure the `node_modules` directory from the project as the package location.
On the other hand, Jest is so useful that I would always install it globally unless there is a very good reason not to do that.

That's it! We are all set to run all tests within our project within IntelliJ using the new run configuration.
Simply press `Ctrl+R` (or `Ctr+D` for debug mode) to run the tests.

### Add a few more Tests

Whether we create another test case or test suite within the same file - or even additional test files - doesn't matter.
The _All Tests_ configuration enables us to run all tests in our application in IntelliJ regardless of where they're located - just like from the command line.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/js-test-intellij/all-tests.png" alt="All tests run..." caption="All tests run..." >}}

## Selectively run Tests

Different to the command line, we're not restricted to running all tests all the time, though.
We also have the debug mode right at hand and can specifically decide what to run or debug right next to the source code:

{{< figure src="/images/posts/js-test-intellij/selective-tests.png" alt="Select what to run" caption="Selective test execution under full control" >}}

With that, we have all the magic I was used to in my Java projects available in a Node.js JavaScript project.

## Bonus: Live Testing

During development, we usually want to run our tests reasonably often to notice as soon as possible when changes break something.

Jest got us covered: It provides `--watch` or `--watchAll` flags that allow us to rerun the tests whenever something changes in the source code.
We will not be able to use `--watch` if the project is not a Git project but `--watchAll` will do the trick in that case.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/js-test-intellij/automatic-rerun.png" alt="Automatically rerun tests" caption="Oops, something broke - automatically rerun tests on code change" >}}

Isn't that awesome?! It's also something I did not know from my work in Java projects.
On the other hand, that's just because I didn't know about the [Infinitest](https://infinitest.github.io/) plugin so far.
