Different than before, we have to use Cisco AnyConnect now to connect to the VPN. Still, there are different VPNs depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on but everything else is quite different.
First of all, this means I can neither use networksetup nor scutil which I have used in my previous script to manage my VPN any longer.</description></item><item><title>Connect to a VPN from the Command Line on Mac OS</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/macos-vpn-command-line/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 11:53:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/macos-vpn-command-line/</guid><description>During Corona time, I have to connect to a VPN most of the time in order to work. I use two different VPNs depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I can select the network to connect to from the status bar at the top of the screen but there seems to be a bug: Sometimes there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to select, so I have to go to the network preferences and connect from there.</description></item></channel></rss>
