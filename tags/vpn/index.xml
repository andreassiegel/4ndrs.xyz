I use two different VPNs depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I can select the network to connect to from the status bar at the top of the screen but there seems to be a bug: Sometimes there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to select, so I have to go to the network preferences and connect from there.</description></item></channel></rss>
