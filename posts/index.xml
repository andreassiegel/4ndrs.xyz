Two of them are Slack and Zoom.
Slack is probably the best tool for instant messaging. Quite a while ago, they introduced a pretty cool feature already known from instant messaging: In addition to just indicating your presence (active/online or away/offline), you can set also set your status to whatever you like, including some icon or emoticon shown right next to your name.</description></item><item><title>Use Cisco AnyConnect to Connect to a VPN from the Command Line on Mac OS</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/macos-vpn-command-line-anyconnect/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:39:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/macos-vpn-command-line-anyconnect/</guid><description>After moving to a new office location, a lot changed &amp;ndash; including the network setup. Different than before, we have to use Cisco AnyConnect now to connect to the VPN. Still, there are different VPNs depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on but everything else is quite different.
First of all, this means I can neither use networksetup nor scutil which I have used in my previous script to manage my VPN any longer.</description></item><item><title>Connect to a VPN from the Command Line on Mac OS</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/macos-vpn-command-line/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 11:53:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/macos-vpn-command-line/</guid><description>During Corona time, I have to connect to a VPN most of the time in order to work. I use two different VPNs depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I can select the network to connect to from the status bar at the top of the screen but there seems to be a bug: Sometimes there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to select, so I have to go to the network preferences and connect from there.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Testing with Jest in IntelliJ IDEA</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/nodejs-test-intellij/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 19:38:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/nodejs-test-intellij/</guid><description>JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE I have ever worked with, and I guess don&amp;rsquo;t ever want to use anything else - or the tool I would prefer to use instead is yet to be invented.
Where it all started Most of the time, I used IntelliJ for Java development. Everything just works, right out of the box. Awesome! However, then there is this moment where you use something else, Node.</description></item><item><title>Multiple Tool Versions via Homebrew</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/multiple-tool-versions-via-homebrew/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 19:41:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/multiple-tool-versions-via-homebrew/</guid><description>Recently, I started using Hugo with an older project. After I pulled the code and ran hugo, it failed. It turned out it was not yet compatible with the latest version that got automatically installed via Homebrew.
Well, no big deal, Homebrew allows for installing older versions of formulae. So I got it working.
Shortly after that, I started another new project (this blog, BTW). Guess what happened? It broke again, this time because the installed version of hugo was too old and not compatible with the configured theme.</description></item><item><title>Building and Testing Golang Applications With Travis CI and Coveralls</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/2017-06-19-building-and-testing-golang-applications-with-travisci-and-coveralls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/2017-06-19-building-and-testing-golang-applications-with-travisci-and-coveralls/</guid><description>Build automation and automatic tests are a really nice thing I am used to when working on Java projects, but since I started to learn Golang recently, I also wanted to have these nice README badges for those projects as well.
Here is how you can set everything up using the free tools Travis CI and Coveralls:
Simple Build Automation Getting started with automatic builds is really easy.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Terraform, AWS &amp; Docker</title><link>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/2017-05-26-getting-started-with-terraform-aws-docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://4ndrs.xyz/posts/2017-05-26-getting-started-with-terraform-aws-docker/</guid><description>This article is an introduction to Terraform and how to use it to set up a basic infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run a simple web service Docker container.
Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code (IAC) tool, that allows for efficiently setting up infrastructure by defining the desired state, which makes it different than many other tools. For more on why you should be using Terraform, check out Gruntwork&amp;#8217;s blog post Why we use Terraform and not Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, or CloudFormation.</description></item></channel></rss>
